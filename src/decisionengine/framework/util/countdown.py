class Countdown:
    """Countdown is a context manager that keeps track of elapsed time.

    It is designed to be used for cases where a sequence of operations
    should not take longer than a specified period of time.  This is done
    by occasionally querying the 'time_left' attribute (e.g.):

        countdown = Countdown(wait_up_to=10)
        for p in processes:
            with countdown:
                rc = p.join(countdown.time_left)
                if rc is None:
                    p.terminate()

    In the above example, the time it takes to shutdown all processes
    should not exceed 10 seconds.  Upon entering the countdown
    context, a timer starts.  Once that context is exited, the timer
    stops and the elapsed time is subtracted from the initial
    'wait_up_to' value.  If it takes 10 seconds for the first process
    to join, then the 'time_left' value will be 0 when joining all
    subsequent processes.  In this way, the entire sequence of
    operations is constrained to occur in roughly 10 seconds.
