class FactLookup:
    '''
    Establishes a policy for looking up a fact based on the given name.

    To wit, the first fact with a given name is the one that is used
    in the evaluation of all subsequent facts.

    As an example, consider the following configuration:

      facts: {
        should_publish: "(True)",
      },
      rules: {
        publish_1: {
          expression: "should_publish",
          facts: ["should_publish"]
        },
        publish_2: {
          expression: "should_publish",
          actions: ["go_to_press"]
          facts: ["should_publish"]
        }
        retract: {
          expression: "not should_publish",
          facts: ["should_retract"]
      }

    In the above, the first fact to be evaluated will always be the
    top-level facts (i.e. those not encapsulated by the 'rules' table).
    The rules labeled 'publish_1' and 'publish_2' both rely on the
    'should_publish' fact in their expressions, and they in turn create
    their own facts with the same name.  FactLookup ensures that
    'publish_1' and 'publish_2' will both use the evaluated fact from
    the top-level 'facts' table.
