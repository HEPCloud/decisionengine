"""The LatestMessages class listens for messages from a set of queues and
retains only the last unconsumed message from each queue.

The latest messages are consumed by calling the consume() instance
method, which returns a dictionary whose key is the message routing
key and whose value is the full message.  If no messages are
available, consume() returns an empty dictionary.

The LatestMessages class is intended to be used as a context manager (e.g.):

  with LatestMessages(queues, broker_url) as messages:
      while some_predicate():
          msgs = messages.consume()
          if not msgs:
              continue

          for routing_key, msg in msgs.items():
              ...

Upon exiting the the context, a LatestMessage object will no longer
listen for any messages.
