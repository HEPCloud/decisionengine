'''
The ProcessingState class can represent any of the following task-manager states:

  BOOT
  IDLE
  ACTIVE
  STEADY
  OFFLINE
  SHUTTINGDOWN
  SHUTDOWN
  ERROR

In addition, the class supports 'wait_until(state)' and 'wait_while(state)' methods,
which, when called from a different process, block until the state has been entered
or exited, respectively.

The 'RUNNING_CONDITIONS' list is a list of states that a thread may have if it is started/starting.
The 'STOPPING_CONDITIONS' list is a list of states that a thread may have if it is stopped/stopping.
The 'INACTIVE_CONDITIONS' list is a list of states that a thread may have when it is not active
