"""Special publisher used to register publish calls with an external file.

It is difficult to interact with individual publishers while testing a
workflow.  The WriteToDisk publisher therefore writes to an external
file that can be read by a test.  Ideally, we would implement a system
so that the test and any instance of the WriteToDisk class are passed
the same file-name string.  Unfortunately, this is non-trivial to
achieve without adjusting the behavior of the decision-engine server
itself.  We therefore choose the following abstruse logic:

- WriteToDisk creates a temporary file and broadcasts its name to
  STDOUT.  Note that this temporary file must be uniquely named as
  multiple tests can use WriteToDisk in parallel.

- Capture STDOUT in the DETestWorker class.

- Pass STDOUT to the 'wait_for_n_writes' which will wait until the
  number 'n' appears in the file.
